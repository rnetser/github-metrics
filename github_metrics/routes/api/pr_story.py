    """Get complete PR story timeline with all events.

    Aggregates all webhook events for a PR into a comprehensive timeline showing
    the complete story from creation to current state or merge/close.

    **Primary Use Cases:**
    - Visualize complete PR lifecycle and history
    - Track when specific events occurred (reviews, approvals, check runs)
    - Debug CI/CD issues by seeing check run history
    - Understand PR review and approval flow
    - Monitor time from creation to merge

    **Parameters:**
    - `repository` (str): Repository in org/repo format (e.g., "myorg/myrepo")
    - `pr_number` (int): Pull request number within the repository

    **Return Structure:**
    See the complete response structure in the module docstring.

    **Events Included:**
    - PR lifecycle (opened, closed, merged, reopened)
    - Code changes (commits/synchronize events)
    - Reviews (approved, changes requested, comments)
    - Labels (added, removed, verified, approved, lgtm)
    - Check runs (CI/CD pipeline status - matched via head_sha)
    - Comments and review requests

    **Event Grouping:**
    - Events within 60 seconds are grouped as parallel
    - Multiple same-type events are collapsed (e.g., "15 check runs")

    **Check Run Matching:**
    Since check_run webhooks don't include PR number, they are matched via
    the PR's head_sha. This ensures all CI/CD events are included.

    **Errors:**
    - 404: PR not found (no webhooks exist for this PR)
    - 500: Database connection error
